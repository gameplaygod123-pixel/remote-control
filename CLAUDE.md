# Personal Remote — Claude working notes

Parsec-like personal remote desktop (Electron + WebRTC). Owner is the sole user
for now (family multi-controller use planned). Owner speaks Thai — reply in Thai.

**Keep this file current: at the end of every working session, update the
"Current status" and "Backlog" sections below and commit, so a fresh chat on
either machine can resume without re-explaining anything.**

## Machines & division of labor

- **Mac** (this repo's home): controller + infrastructure hub — signaling server,
  cloudflared tunnel, supervisor LaunchAgent (`com.personalremote.signaling`),
  source of truth. Mac-side Claude reviews, merges, builds, releases.
- **Windows PC**: the agent (controlled machine). Has its own Claude Code for
  implementing/testing anything that needs real Windows hardware. Works on
  `fix/*` branches and pushes; Mac side merges.
- Diagnostics: agent-side helper log at `%TEMP%\input-helper.log`;
  signaling log at `~/Library/Logs/personal-remote-signaling.log` (Mac).

## Golden rules (learned the hard way — do not skip)

1. **Native/FFI code (koffi Win32 calls, node-datachannel) MUST ship as a
   PRERELEASE first** and be verified on the real Windows machine. A bad FFI
   signature segfaults natively; JS try/catch cannot catch it. v1.15.0 shipped
   untested Win32 clipboard FFI → helper crash-respawn loop → v1.15.1 revert.
2. Everything else ships directly as a **full release** (auto-update) while the
   owner is the only user. Reinstate the prerelease gate when family joins.
3. Build Windows installers ONLY via `scripts/build-win.sh` — it requires
   `VITE_SIGNALING_URL`, swaps the node-datachannel darwin→win32 binary, and
   verifies koffi/node-datachannel win32 binaries are packed. v1.11.0 shipped
   pointing at localhost because this was skipped.
4. Never add unverified ICE servers. libjuice picks ONE stun server per attempt
   with no fallback — a dead server (openrelay was) makes sessions fail
   alternately. Current: Google + Cloudflare STUN, both verified.
5. `koffi.load()` must be lazy (inside functions), never at module scope — it
   crashes the Mac controller at import time.
6. asar is disabled on purpose (the pure-Node input helper can't read asar).
7. Release flow: `gh release create --prerelease` → owner tests on real
   hardware (connect/Back cycles, Thai+English typing, X-close mid-session) →
   `gh release edit --prerelease=false`.

## Architecture crib notes

- **Core constraint**: Chromium throttles the ENTIRE Electron process (main
  process included — timers and socket I/O) when the agent window is hidden.
  Anything that must survive window-hide lives in the pure-Node **input helper**
  (`src/input-helper/`, forked with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, uses
  node-datachannel). Renderer keeps video + file-transfer.
- Two peer connections: video pc (renderer↔renderer) and input pc
  (controller renderer ↔ helper). Signaling messages carry
  `channel: 'video' | 'input'`; capability negotiation via `caps:
  ['input-helper']` on pair/connection messages (old servers strip unknown
  fields → graceful fallback).
- Input injection on Windows: raw `user32.SendInput` via koffi —
  `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` for text (layout-independent Thai), VK + scan codes
  (MapVirtualKeyW) for held keys/shortcuts. libnut keyboard silently no-ops
  from windowless processes; mouse still uses nut.js.
- Self-healing: helper retries negotiation 3× then exits → host respawns
  (2s); ping/pong liveness (10s/5s); controller rebuilds input pc on every
  input-channel offer; agent drops video pc on helper-down → auto re-pair.
- Signaling URL is resolved at runtime from `signaling-url.json` on GitHub
  (raw.githubusercontent.com, ~5-min CDN cache), re-resolved on every
  reconnect; the supervisor auto-publishes tunnel URL changes.

## Current status (updated 2026-07-06)

Latest release: **v1.15.1** (full release, hotfix).

Working and verified on real hardware:
- Latency ≈ Parsec (direct connection, ~11 ms network).
- Mouse + keyboard survive agent window hidden/X-closed (native helper).
- Thai/English typing + shortcuts; Windows grave `~` layout toggle.
- Typed language follows the CONTROLLER machine's layout (deliberate design —
  each user switches language on their own machine).
- File transfer controller→agent (tested with a 580 MB file).
- Auto-update via GitHub Releases; signaling self-heals via supervisor.

NOT working:
- **Clipboard sync is fully non-functional in helper mode** (gap since
  v1.14.0, not a regression). First fix attempt (v1.15.0, commit `acecaa0`)
  crashed the helper and was reverted in v1.15.1. NOTE: owner also runs
  Parsec sometimes — its clipboard sync can mask ours in tests.

## Backlog (rough priority)

1. **Clipboard sync while agent hidden** (chosen next task): re-apply the
   reverted architecture (`git cherry-pick acecaa0` onto a fix branch —
   clipboardSyncCore + clipboardNative + wiring), but Windows-side Claude must
   first verify the Win32 clipboard FFI (OpenClipboard/GlobalAlloc/GlobalLock/
   SetClipboardData via koffi) with an isolated ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE test on
   real hardware (ASCII + Thai roundtrip, 100 iterations, no crash). Segfault
   suspects, in order: `OpenClipboard(0)` number-vs-null for `void*`;
   `koffi.decode(ptr,'str16')` on GlobalLock pointer; `koffi.encode` into
   GlobalAlloc'd memory; surrogate-pair sizing. Ship as PRERELEASE (rule 1).
2. Verify file transfer with the agent window actually hidden (works via the
   renderer video pc, which is subject to throttling — needs a real test).
3. Real AGENT_TOKEN (currently `dev-token-change-me`) — before family use.
4. Computers-page search/sort; per-controller device visibility (family use).
5. Known limitation: helper crash mid-session recovers input only at re-pair.
6. No TURN relay (only matters for CGNAT↔CGNAT pairs).
7. Mac installer (.dmg) — deferred by owner decision.
